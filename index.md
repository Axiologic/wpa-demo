## Starts fast, stays fast
Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online experience, because high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing ones. Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric performance metrics.

Follow [this guide](https://web.dev/fast/) on fast load times to learn how to make your PWA start fast and stay fast.

## Works in any browser
Users can use any browser they choose to access your web app before it's installed.

## Responsive to any screen size
Users can use your PWA on any screen size and all of the content is available at any viewport size.

## Provides a custom offline page
When users are offline, keeping them in your PWA provides a more seamless experience than dropping back to the default browser offline page.

## Is installable
Users who install or add apps to their device tend to engage with those apps more.


# Optimal Progressive Web App checklist
To create a truly great Progressive Web App, one that feels like a best-in-class app, you need more than just the core checklist. The optimal Progressive Web App checklist is about making your PWA feel like it's part of the device it's running on while taking advantage of what makes the web powerful.

## Provides an offline experience
Where connectivity isn't strictly required, your app works the same offline as it does online.

## Is fully accessible
All user interactions pass WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements.

## Can be discovered through search
Your PWA can be easily discovered through search.

## Works with any input type
Your PWA is equally usable with a mouse, a keyboard, a stylus, or touch.

## Provides context for permission requests
When asking permission to use powerful APIs, provide context and ask only when the API is needed.

## Follows best practices for healthy code
Keeping your codebase healthy makes it easier to meet your goals and deliver new features.
