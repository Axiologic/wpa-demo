  # Core Progressive Web App checklist
<br />

The Progressive Web App Checklist describes what makes an app installable and usable by all users, regardless of size or input type.
<br />

## Starts fast, stays fast
Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online experience, because high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing ones. Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric performance metrics.

Follow [this guide](https://web.dev/fast/) on fast load times to learn how to make your PWA start fast and stay fast.

## Works in any browser
Users can use any browser they choose to access your web app before it's installed.

## Responsive to any screen size
Users can use your PWA on any screen size and all of the content is available at any viewport size.

## Provides a custom offline page
When users are offline, keeping them in your PWA provides a more seamless experience than dropping back to the default browser offline page.

### How
[Workbox](https://web.dev/workbox/) is the recommended approach for adding service workers to websites because it automates a lot of boilerplate, makes it easier to follow best practices, and prevents subtle bugs that are common when using the low-level ServiceWorker API directly.
1. Add a service worker to your app.
2. Use the service worker to cache files locally.
3. When offline, use the service worker as a network proxy to return the locally cached version of the file.

#### Workbox CLI
The Workbox command line interface (contained in the workbox-cli package) consists of a Node.js program called workbox that can be run from a Windows, macOS, of UNIX-compatible command line environment. Under the hood, workbox-cli wraps the workbox-build module, and provides an easy way of integrating Workbox into a command line build process, with flexible configurations.

Install the CLI
```
npm install workbox-cli --global
```


CLI Modes
The CLI has four different modes:

- wizard: A step-by-step guide to set up Workbox for your project.
```
workbox wizard
```
- generateSW: Generates a complete service worker for you.
```
workbox generateSW path/to/config.js
```
- injectManifest: Injects the assets to precache into your project.
- copyLibraries: Copy the Workbox libraries into a directory.


Build Process Integration

After installing workbox-cli as a development dependency for your local project, you can add the call to workbox at the end of your existing build process's npm script:

From package.json:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-build-script && workbox <mode> <path/to/config.js>"
  }
}
```


## Is installable
Users who install or add apps to their device tend to engage with those apps more.


# Optimal Progressive Web App checklist
To create a truly great Progressive Web App, one that feels like a best-in-class app, you need more than just the core checklist. The optimal Progressive Web App checklist is about making your PWA feel like it's part of the device it's running on while taking advantage of what makes the web powerful.

## Provides an offline experience
Where connectivity isn't strictly required, your app works the same offline as it does online.

## Is fully accessible
All user interactions pass WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements.

## Can be discovered through search
Your PWA can be easily discovered through search.

## Works with any input type
Your PWA is equally usable with a mouse, a keyboard, a stylus, or touch.

## Provides context for permission requests
When asking permission to use powerful APIs, provide context and ask only when the API is needed.

## Follows best practices for healthy code
Keeping your codebase healthy makes it easier to meet your goals and deliver new features.
